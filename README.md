The proposed project is a follow up for an ongoing research project by PhD. Students at the Northeastern University Computer Architecture Research lab. The idea is to enhance the implementation of the fast level set segmentation algorithm using parallel coding, targeting efficiency of execution in GPUâ€™s and cluster computing. This algorithm is commonly used in image segmentation, partitioning an image into regions of interest to be able to detect specific objects in the image.

The overall objective would be to create an application that is efficient in execution so that it can be added as part of the NUPAR benchmark suite and help target performance on modern architectures.
