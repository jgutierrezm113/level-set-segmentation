Please note inside this folder there are different cuda implementations targetting higher performance. Current versions are:

Cuda-NonOpt
-----------
	No Optimization done.
	This is the first implementation of the program. It basically covers the algorithm specified in the documentation, without any sort of improvement for performance.

Cuda-OGA
--------
	Optimized Global Access.
	This is an enhancement over the first implementation that improved the access to the synchronization variable in global memory, significantly reducing the execution time, and avoiding race conditions.

Cuda-OGA+MC+P+SCM
-----------------
	Optimized Global Access + Memory Coalesce improvement + Packeting + Shared Char Memory
	This is the most optimized version of the code. It has the optimized global memory access mentioned before, improved memory coalescing, packeting of char values into int, and reduced Shared Memory space and improved performance by using chars.
