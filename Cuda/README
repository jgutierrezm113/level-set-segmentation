To run simulation test do the following in the discovery cluster:

In Cuda folder:
	make all
	cd inputs/sample/
	make all
	make run
	cd ../../scripts/
	
	<interactively choose a gpu node>

	bsub -Is -XF -q par-gpu -n 1 /bin/bash
	
Run script:
	cd scripts/
	./Run.bash

To view results:
	cd ../results/discovery-omp/

	- Open the output images using gnome-open (might need to copy file to personal computer
	  given discovery doesn't allow image viewing)
	- Open output.log for execution times
